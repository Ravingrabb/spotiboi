"First of all, Spotiboi was created to work with a <a "

"playlists</a> service. Spotiboi collects information about the songs you "
"listened to and moves these songs into a separate playlist called "
"\"History\". In the future, you can use the \"History\" playlist to "
"create smart playlists and exclude songs you've already listened to."
